This improved code explicitly checks the return value of `fopen` to ensure the file was opened successfully before proceeding with further operations.  It also includes error handling to gracefully manage cases where file operations fail.
```php
<?php
$file = fopen('somefile.txt', 'r');
if ($file === false) {
    // Handle the error appropriately
    die('Error opening file: ' . error_get_last()['message']);
}
$contents = fread($file, 1024);
if ($contents === false) {
    // Handle the error
    die('Error reading from file: ' . error_get_last()['message']);
}
echo $contents;
fclose($file);
?>
```
