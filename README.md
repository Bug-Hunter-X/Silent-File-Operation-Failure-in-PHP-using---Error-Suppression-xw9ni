This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in PHP involving file operations and error suppression using the `@` operator. The `bug.php` file shows how `@fread` silences errors when a file operation fails, leading to unexpected application behavior without any warning.  The `bugSolution.php` file offers a more robust approach to handle potential errors during file operations.
